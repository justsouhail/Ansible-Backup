## Introduction
I'm developing an Ansible-based backup automation project for firewalls (Fortinet, Palo Alto, F5) and network devices (Cisco switches and routers). The project includes a web interface to manage and monitor the automation process. Initially, I'm using PNetLab for simulation, with plans to transition to real-world scenarios for deployment and testing.

## Steps

### ðŸ”¹ **Phase 1: Environment Setup**  
- [ ] Set up **PNetLab** with firewall and network device images  
- [ ] Install **Ansible** and required dependencies  
- [ ] Configure SSH & API access for devices  
- [ ] Define Ansible inventory for network devices  

### ðŸ”¹ **Phase 2: Backup Automation**  
- [ ] Create Ansible playbooks for:  
  - [ ] **Fortinet** backup  
  - [ ] **Palo Alto** backup  
  - [ ] **Cisco switches/routers** backup
  - [ ] **F5** backup  
- [ ] Implement a  FTP  solution  
- [ ] Schedule automated backups

### ðŸ”¹ **Phase 3: Web Interface Development**  
- [ ] Design a **dashboard** for backup management  

### ðŸ”¹ **Phase 4: Testing & Real-World Deployment**  
- [ ] Validate automation in **PNetLab**  
- [ ] Deploy to real devices in a **test environment**
